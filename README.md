# Brainstems, a Decentralized Federated Intelligence Mesh (DeFim) Protocol

## Overview
This document outlines the Brainstems Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) blockchain protocol, a key component of the Decentralized Federated Intelligence Mesh (DeFim). The protocol enables companies to interoperate their AIs through a decentralized and secure framework.

## Node Roles

### Light Computation Nodes

#### Purpose
Contribute data to the network with minimal computational load.

#### Responsibilities
- Share data securely, ensuring privacy and confidentiality.
- Perform light preprocessing or encryption of data.
- Participate in validation processes with minimal computational load.

### Full Computation Nodes

#### Purpose
Perform the heavy lifting of computations within the federated learning process.

#### Responsibilities
- Calculate weighted vectors from data and encrypt them before sharing.
- Engage in multi-party computation protocols to enhance data privacy.
- Ensure the computed vectors are securely transmitted to Aggregation Nodes.

### Aggregation Nodes

#### Purpose
Central to the learning process, these nodes integrate contributions to update and improve the foundational model.

#### Responsibilities
- Receive and securely aggregate encrypted weighted vectors.
- Update the foundational model without compromising data privacy.
- Implement checks against malicious inputs and ensure contributions are correctly weighted.

### Validation Nodes

#### Purpose
Ensure the fairness and integrity of the training process and data quality.

#### Responsibilities
- Validate the fairness of training and the integrity of data used.
- Prevent the inclusion of corrupt or malicious data.
- Monitor for malicious activity and implement countermeasures as necessary.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Security and Privacy**: Utilize cryptographic techniques like homomorphic encryption, secure multi-party computation, and zero-knowledge proofs.
- **Incentive Mechanisms**: Design an incentive structure to fairly reward contributions.
- **Scalability and Efficiency**: Optimize for large-scale operations and network throughput.
- **Interoperability**: Ensure compatibility with existing systems for easy adoption.

This framework is designed to foster collaborative AI development, leveraging blockchain technology for a secure, private, and equitable federated learning environment.
